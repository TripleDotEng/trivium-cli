              For a number of years now, work has been proceeding in order to
              bring perfection to the crudely conceived idea of a transmission
              that would not only supply inverse reactive current for use in
              unilateral phase detractors, but would also be capable of
              automatically synchronizing cardinal grammeters. Such an instrument
              is the turbo encabulator.

              Now basically the only new principle involved is that instead of
              power being generated by the relative motion of conductors and fluxes,
              it is produced by the modial interaction of magneto-reluctance and
              capacitive diractance.

              The original machine had a base plate of pre-famulated amulite
              surmounted by a malleable logarithmic casing in such a way that the
              two spurving bearings were in a direct line with the panametric fan.
              The latter consisted simply of six hydrocoptic marzlevanes, so fitted
              to the ambifacient lunar waneshaft that side fumbling was effectively
              prevented.

              The main winding was of the normal lotus-o-delta type placed in
              panendermic semi-boloid slots of the stator, every seventh conductor
              being connected by a non-reversible tremie pipe to the differential
              girdle spring on the “up” end of the grammeters

              The turbo-encabulator has now reached a high level of development,
              and it’s being successfully used in the operation of novertrunnions.
              Moreover, whenever a forescent skor motion is required, it may also
              be employed in conjunction with a drawn reciprocation dingle arm, to
              reduce sinusoidal repleneration.
